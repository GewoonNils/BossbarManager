# BossbarManager
_This is just a simple plugin for an issue I encountered_

## What does it do?
It adds an extra bossbar to help space out so that you can use the axboosters bossbar with a custom hud which uses the bossbar. You can also just use it as a second bossbar for placeholder events.

## Dependencies
- [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)

## Soft Dependecies
- [Betterhud](https://github.com/toxicity188/BetterHud) (Makes the bossbar invisible)
